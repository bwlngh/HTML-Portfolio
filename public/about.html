<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer.  Thus far, my coding languages are Python and SQL.
  I use both languages daily in my professional life, first as a data manager, and currently as a business intelligence
  developer. My duties include occasionally perform data engineering, data analytics, and data science techniques.

  My hobbies are anything space related: star gazing, rocketry, space launch, space craft, orbital mechanics,
  celestial bodies, astronomy, and pretty much anything in the cosmos. Basically, I like most scientific topics that are
  organic or inorganic.
